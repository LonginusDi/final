Got Pusher working in Activities page! If one user adds a movie to favorite, All other users will know this immediately in activities page. This is an addition to my screencast since I uploaded the video on Monday. In order to reduce the repo size, I have uploaded my background video online. It works fine on localhost and with safari and firefox on heroku, but sometimes it fails to work with chrome.
